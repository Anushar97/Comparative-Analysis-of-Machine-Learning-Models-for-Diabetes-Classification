*Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Diabetes Classification*

*Simple Overview*

This project explores the application of various machine learning models to classify diabetes in individuals. By analyzing a dataset of 101,766 patient records with 47 attributes, the project compares the performance of eight models, including single and ensemble learning algorithms, to identify the most effective approach for diabetes prediction.

*Overview*

Diabetes is a prevalent global health issue requiring accurate and timely classification for effective treatment and prevention. This project investigates machine learning models to address the challenge of diabetes classification, comparing their performance through metrics like accuracy and F1-score. The dataset includes key demographic and clinical attributes. Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others are evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting diabetes. The results emphasize the superiority of ensemble methods in tackling complex classification tasks and highlight areas for future improvements, such as feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization.
